# Personal Preferences

## Tools
- Use MCP tools for Figma, Jira, and Notion links.

## Communication
- Keep responses concise. Avoid unnecessary preambles, repeated explanations, or excessive confirmation questions.
- Prefer concrete code examples over abstract explanations when discussing code or APIs.

## After Code Changes
- Verify no stale references remain by grepping for old names/patterns.
- Run type-check to ensure no type errors were introduced.
